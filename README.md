# One Time Pad Encryption
One time pad encryption implementation in Python. One Time Pad is an encryption type that is known for 'perfect secrecy' if used correctly. Unfortunately, PRNGs are not a great way of generating truly random numbers which is a requirement for this encryption method to actually work perfectly and remain secret.
